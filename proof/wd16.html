          <h3>Exploration of historical data and potential solution for the missing information in the Iberian sardine DEPM survey (SAREVA 0320) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.</header>

       			<h3> <p align="left">Abstract </font></h3> 
	
<p align="justify">As part of the Iberian DEPM survey for sardine (Sardina pilchardus), two spring surveys are carried out every three years by Portugal (IPMA; PT-DEMP-PIL) and Spain (IEO; SAREVA). The total spawning biomass from the two DEPM surveys is used in the assessment such as fishery independent index for the sardine stock pil.27.8c9a (ICES divisions 8.c and 9.a -Cantabrian Sea and Atlantic Iberian waters). In 2020 both surveys were planned and coordinated under the framework of the ICES WGACEGG. The Portuguese survey was successfully conducted, however, the Spanish survey; SAREVA0320, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 health crisis and the subsequent ‘state of alarm’ lockdown in Spain. This working document provides a description of methods explored to compensate the lack of data in ICES areas 9aN and 8c caused by the cancelation of sardine DEPM survey “SAREVA 0320”.  After checking that sardine egg data obtained from the anchovy DEPM survey, delivered in a partial area of division 8c during May by AZTI Tecnalia (BIOMAN), were not adequate for extrapolating to the SAREVA surveyed area, alternative analysis were presented based on i) sardine eggs historic data from the CUFES sampler used in the acoustic Spanish surveys PELACUS and ii) spawning stock biomass data from the Portuguese survey PT-DEPM-PIL and the Spanish survey SAREVA. A methodological approach similar to those adopted in the last sardine assessment (ICES, 2020) to face the problem of the acoustic lack of data in 2020 in subdivisions 9aN and division 8c, is described, reasoned and suggested as a solution to face the lack of Spanish data for sardine stock assessment in 2020.</p>
