          <h3>First approach to the growth and age corroboration of Northeast Atlantic chub mackerel (<em>Scomber colias</em>) in northern Iberian Waters. </header>

	
            <h2>  <p align="center">Abstract </p></h2> <p align="justify"> Atlantic chub mackerel, Scomber colias , is a pelagic species whose distribution is expanding in recent years in the East Atlantic Ocean northward, from African to European Atlantic waters, with a great impact on pelagic fisheries. The population structure and the stock or stocks status remain unknown, and detailed information on growth and population age structure is required for future stock assessment. In this study, the growth pattern and parameters of Atlantic chub mackerel in Northern Iberian waters were analysed with different approaches, using methodologies based on otolith analyses (direct age estimation-DAE, back-calculation-BC and otolith marginal analyses) and length frequency analyses (Bhattacharya, SLCA and PROJMAT methods). For that purpose, seven years (2011-2017) time series of data were analysed. Two main different growth patterns were obtained, showing growth performance indices ( ɸ‘ ) between 2.76-2.78 (DAE, BC and LFDA from surveys) and equal to 2.86 (Bhattacharya and LFDA from commercial landings). Similar mean lengths were obtained at the first two age groups (~22, ~27-28 cm) independently of the considered method; however, the divergence begins to be evident at age 3 and older. Otolith marginal analyses showed an annual periodicity in the formation of the hyaline and opaque edge, showing a prevalence of the opaque edge mainly from June to December, what in addition to the unimodal distribution of the annuli radius and the obtained back-calculated mean lengths, similar to those obtained by DAE, support the age estimation criteria used in this study. The growth parameters here obtained are compared with those from previous studies in other areas. The present study is the first approach to the growth of S. colias in Northern Iberian waters, being results available for the upcoming stock assessment process.</p>
